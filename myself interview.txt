Final Professional Myself Introduction (Family Details ke Saath):

"Good morning/afternoon,
My name is Suraj Jha, and I am 24 years old. I was born in Kandivali, Mumbai, and originally belong to Bihar. I have completed my SSC and HSC under the Maharashtra Board, followed by a B.Sc. in Information Technology from DTSS College, Mumbai University, with a CGPA of 8.14. Later, I pursued my M.Sc. in Information Technology from the same college and secured a CGPA of 8.75.

After completing my education, I enhanced my technical skills by completing a Full Stack Java Developer course from Keerti Institute. I also completed a 1-month internship in Core Java at TrueU Technology.

Following my internship, I worked for 1 year as a Web Developer at Itarsia India Services Pvt. Ltd., where I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development. On the front end, I worked with technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. For the back end, I primarily worked with Core PHP along with MySQL database.

Apart from that, I have a good knowledge of Core Java, JSP, Servlets, and React.js. All my project work is available on my GitHub profile.

Talking about my family, we are five members. My father is currently not working. My mother works as a cook in different households. I have a younger brother who is currently studying in 12th standard, and I have two elder sisters who are both married recently.

I am passionate about software development, always eager to learn new technologies, and continuously working to improve my skills. I am now looking for an opportunity where I can apply my knowledge, enhance my professional growth, and contribute to the success of the organization."
