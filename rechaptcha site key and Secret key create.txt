Step-by-Step Guide to Obtain reCAPTCHA Keys:

1. Visit the reCAPTCHA Admin Console
Go to the Google reCAPTCHA website: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create

2. Sign In to Your Google Account
Log in using your Google account. If you don't have one, create a Google account first.

3. Register Your Website


Fill in the form to register your website for reCAPTCHA:
Label: Enter a name for your website (e.g., "My Website reCAPTCHA").
reCAPTCHA Type: Select the version of reCAPTCHA you want to use:


reCAPTCHA v2: (Recommended for basic forms)
“I'm not a robot” Checkbox: Shows the classic checkbox for users to confirm they're not robots.
Invisible reCAPTCHA: Runs without user interaction unless necessary.


reCAPTCHA v3: (Advanced, works without user interaction and gives a score)
Domains: Add your domain (e.g., example.com). If you're testing locally, use localhost.
Owners: Your Google email is added by default. You can add additional owners if needed.
Accept Terms of Service: Check the box to agree to Google's terms.


4. Submit and Get Your Keys
Click the Submit button.
You'll receive the following:
Site Key: Use this in the frontend (data-sitekey in the HTML).
Secret Key: Use this in the backend for verification.


5. Integrate reCAPTCHA
Frontend: Add the reCAPTCHA widget using the Site Key.
Backend: Verify the reCAPTCHA response using the Secret Key.
Example Integration:



Frontend:
html
Copy code
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>



Backend:
Replace YOUR_SECRET_KEY in the verification script with your actual Secret Key.
