Breakpoints in Bootstrap:

xs (Extra small, <576px): Default stacking.
sm (Small, ≥576px).
md (Medium, ≥768px): Apply order-md-* for medium and above.
lg (Large, ≥992px), xl (Extra large, ≥1200px): Adjust as needed.

Key Notes on Column Ordering with Bootstrap:
Default Behavior:

In a Bootstrap row, columns stack vertically (one on top of the other) on small screens (mobile), and appear horizontally side by side on larger screens.
Using order-* Classes:

order-1: Makes the column appear first.
order-2: Makes the column appear second, and so on.
You can use order-md-* to apply this logic starting from the medium screen size (md breakpoint).
Mobile View Adjustment:

By default, columns stack vertically in the order they appear in the HTML.
To make an image appear first (on top) in mobile view:
Leave the default stack order for smaller screens (xs).
Use order-md-2 to push the image column second for medium and larger screens.
Desktop View Adjustment:

To make the text appear first (on the left) in larger screens:
Apply order-md-1 to the text column.
This ensures it takes precedence over the image column on medium and larger screens.
